# How to Execute

1. Create a .env file.
    * Create a file named .env in the folder you clone this repo into.
    * In the file, type:  
        MONGO_URI=ENTER YOUR MONGO URI HERE
    * Please contact the developers to use their Mongo URI.

2. Run the node part of the application.
    * Use `npm start` in the terminal in the folder you clone this repo into.
    * Once the page loads, it will (hopefully) tell you to open index.html

3. Run index.html
    * We recommend using VS Code for this.
    * Download any live server extension for VS Code. 
        > We recommend the Live Server extension by Ritwick Dey.
    * Right click on index.html and click on "Open with Live Server"
